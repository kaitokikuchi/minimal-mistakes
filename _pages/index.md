I'm Kaito Kikuchi, a Ph.D student in the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego. I'm broadly interested in gaining systems-level insight into bacterial physiology, and am part of the [qBio PhD Specialization](http://qbio.ucsd.edu/).

I use fluorescence microscopy and computational analysis to understand how *Bacillus subtilis* uses electrical signals to communicate and coordinate behavior at both the single-cell and community level.
\\

I did my Masters with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html)  at the University of Tokyo doing *Escherichia coli* single cell observations, and was also a Research Assistant at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm) mining protein-protein interaction networks. Prior to that, I did my BA thesis with [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at International Christian University on extremophile DNA repair mechanisms.

In my free time I love to cook/bake, surf, bike, travel, and drink coffee/beer.
