I'm Kaito Kikuchi, a PhD candidate in the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego. I'm interested in gaining systems-level insight into microbial physiology, and am currently working on electrochemical signals in *Bacillus subtilis*.

I did my Masters with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo, and was also a Research Assistant at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm). Before that, I did my senior thesis with [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at International Christian University.

In my free time I like to cook, bake, surf, read, and travel.
