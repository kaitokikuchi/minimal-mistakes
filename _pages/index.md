I'm Kaito Kikuchi, a PhD student in the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego. I'm broadly interested in gaining systems-level insight into bacterial physiology, and I use fluorescence microscopy and computational analyses to understand how the bacterium *Bacillus subtilis* uses electrical signals to control spatiotemporal dynamics.

I did my Masters with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo, and was also a Research Assistant at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm). Prior to that, I did my senior thesis with [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at International Christian University.

In my free time I love to cook/bake, surf, read, travel, and drink coffee/beer.
